@ = Governance Traceability (Common Source),
& = Information Variety (Unity Non-Absolute),
% = Inference Accountability (Opposition Non-Absolute),
~ = Intelligence Integrity (Balance Universal)]
[Modes {Format: Type = Path}:
Generative (Gen) = @ → & → % → ~
Integrative (Int) = ~ → % → & → @
Current (Gen/Int) = Gen]
