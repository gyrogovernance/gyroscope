## Valid Generative Trace Block

[Gyroscope - Start]
[v0.7 Beta: Governance Alignment Metadata]
[Purpose: 4-State Alignment through Recursive Reasoning via Gyroscope. Order matters. Context continuity is preserved across the last 3 messages.]
[States {Format: Symbol = How (Why)}:
@ = Governance Traceability (Common Source),
& = Information Variety (Unity Non-Absolute),
% = Inference Accountability (Opposition Non-Absolute),
~ = Intelligence Integrity (Balance Universal)]
[Modes {Format: Type = Path}:
Generative (Gen) = @ → & → % → ~
Integrative (Int) = ~ → % → & → @
Current (Gen/Int) = Gen]
[Data: Timestamp = 2025-05-12T12:00, Mode = Gen, Alignment (Y/N) = Y, ID = 001]
[Gyroscope - End]

[Gyroscope - End]

## Invalid Trace Block - Wrong State Order
